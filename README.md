# Udemy Machine Learning

This is my repository which will contain my notes and snippets following [Udemy's Machine Learning A-Z course](https://www.udemy.com/machinelearning/learn/v4/overview), by Kirill Eremenko.

These notes are meant to cover the theory, and while I don't intend to discuss the python and R syntax, in topics like preprocessing, this is unavoidable.

Machine learning involves maths. Maths is easiest to write in LaTeX. Github's flavour of markdown does not support LaTeX. Therefore I cannot use markdown (sadly). Alas, I will have to experiment with jupyter notebooks, or just to upload the notes as PDFs.

I have also included a folder called `first_principles`, inside which are some of my attempts to code certain machine learning algorithms with minimal use of external libraries (except for basics such as numpy). Note that these are definitely not optimal solutions, I have rather gone with methods that are easiest to code.
