# Udemy Machine Learning

This is my repository which will contain my notes and snippets following [Udemy's Machine Learning A-Z course](https://www.udemy.com/machinelearning/learn/v4/overview), by Kirill Eremenko.

These notes are meant to cover the theory, and while I don't intend to discuss the python and R syntax, in topics like preprocessing, this is unavoidable.

Machine learning involves maths. Maths is easiest to write in LaTeX. Github's flavour of markdown does not support LaTeX. Therefore I cannot use markdown (sadly). Alas, I will have to experiment with jupyter notebooks.
