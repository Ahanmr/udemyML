# Python versus R

## Data preprocessing

R requires far fewer packages, and we never have to deal with instantiating objects etc.

- In python it is easier to split into training/testing sets, and to impute values.
- However, everything else is easier in R.
- OneHotEncoder, although cumbersome to use, often makes life a lot easier down the road.

Verdict: **R**.

## Linear regression

- All of the functions are built in for R. Very intuitive syntax
- Backward elimination to improve the model requires about 10 lines of code in python, but it is a single line builtin in R.

**Verdict: Strong R**
